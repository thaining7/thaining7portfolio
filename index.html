                <p>In your world you can create anything you desire. Almost everything is going to happen for you
                    automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Use what you see, don't plan
                    it. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Just think about
                    these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>
                <p>Just use the old one inch brush. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. You could sit
                    here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with
                    an almighty brush. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Let's have a happy little tree in
                    here.
                </p>
