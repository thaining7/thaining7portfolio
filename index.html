                <p>Hello, I'm Trevor! I am a full stack web developer with strength in front end development. I have a certificate in full stack web
                    development, specifically the MERN stack, from the University of Minnesota Continuing Education Department. My skills include HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Node, React, APIs and other frameworks and
                    languages. I am also an experienced professional freelance percussionist. I come from a musical family and have been playing drums since age two. I play a variety of styles including Jazz, variety music and orchestral percussion. I am excited about building things and I am a creative thinker with the ability to think outside the
                    box. Whether it's studying music, building an application, orchestrating a drum solo, fixing a car or tinkering with a Linux operating system, I enjoy the challenge of building something new and discovering more about how to solve problems in the process.</p>
